# VL.Rhino.3dm

The Rhino.3dm Library for VL provides developers and modelers with a streamlined way to integrate Rhino3D geometry and data into their VL projects. With this library, developers can import Rhino3D files and access their geometry, materials, cameras and user data from objects directly within the programming environment.


## Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.Rhino.3dm
